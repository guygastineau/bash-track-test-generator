# test generator class for the bash track

###
# This class allows simple ERB templates to generate tests from the
# canonical-data.json file stored in the problem-specifications repo
# for each exercise.
#
# This class is invoked by the test_generator.rb script which is
# called by the wrapper bin/generate_test written in bash.
#
# For clarification on this project please checkout the dicumentation
# at TODO
